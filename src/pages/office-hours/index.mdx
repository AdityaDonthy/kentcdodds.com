# KCD Office Hours

Once a week, Kent is available for an hour to answer any questions you have.
This is especially helpful for [KCD Learning Clubs](/clubs) but everyone is
invited. Office hours is held on Zoom (you need to be logged into your Zoom
account to join).

To join, simply join the [KCD Discord](/discord) community, and jump in the
[`#üè´-office-hours`](https://kcd.im/discord-office-hours) channel to ask
questions and get the links that I share with my responses.

[9:30-10:30 AM Mountain Time](<https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=9%3A30%20am&tz=Mountain%20Time%20(MT)&>).

you'll find recordings of previous office hours.
