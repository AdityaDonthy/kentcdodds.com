Dear Boss,

Our team has been working hard to make the product serve our customers the best
we can. It's been a real challenge. One of our biggest challenges is developer
velocity. We love React and we want to ship our app better and faster with a
deep understanding of the framework and using proven techniques to ensure the
long-term maintainability of the app. Right now, our strategy is basically
"change things until it works."

There are plenty of reasons for this, but if we continue down this road, the
application will grow increasingly complex until it takes longer and longer to
deliver features and bug fixes. **We need expert training to take our entire
team to the next level.** And we need everyone on the team to be on the same
page to be as productive as possible.

This is why we're asking you for team licenses to
[EpicReact.dev](https://epicreact.dev). It's the best place for us to learn
everything we need to get a solid understanding of React's latest and most
important features and how to leverage that to make our React app into one that
scales over time and relies less on one or two of our most expert devs (where
the bus factor can be a bit of a concern).

The best and the brightest in the industry recommend EpicReact.dev for learning
all about React applications just like ours. With team licenses, we can go
through the mountain of available material together and get onto common ground
with regard to our product quality vision and direction.

The author, [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com), is a highly respected
member of the community and we use open source software that he has created and
contributed to. He has deep knowledge of React and has taught hundreds of
thousands of software engineers. He's even the author and maintainer of some of
the open source tools we use with React.

Please do let us know if you have questions. We'd love to discuss it. To get
things started, go to
[the "buy" section of EpicReact.com](https://epicreact.dev#buy), enable the
"Teams" pricing, and buy a license for each member of the team.

Thanks.

â€“ The team
