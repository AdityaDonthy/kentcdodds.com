Every place I've worked, someone else built the API that I was consuming. Often
that API already existed, but often it was being built while I was building the
frontend for it. And even if it was already "finished," it often was incomplete
or buggy. In any case, I couldn't always rely on the backend to work for me
during development.

This was often a source of frustration for me. Until I found
[MSW](https://mswjs.io/). This was a game changer. Before my hacks were
intrusive on my source code. They involved hard-coding the return value from a
function that was supposed to make an API call. Just don't forget to remove that
before pushing to production ðŸ˜¬

With MSW, I'm able to take that same hard-coded data and have it handled at the
network request layer without it spidering throughout my codebase. I can make
regular network requests and MSW can intercept them from it's little corner of
my development tooling setup. And then I can take that same MSW code and reuse
it in my tests rather than mocking fetch
([which is a bad idea](/blog/stop-mocking-fetch)).

With MSW, I don't worry about the API changing from under me when I'm the middle
of developing my feature. I can work in isolation if I want to (MSW works with
storybook super well) but I don't have to. I can work on my components in the
context of the entire application without worrying about the stability of the
APIs I'm using. I can write integration tests without have to mock and re-mock
every request all my components make.
