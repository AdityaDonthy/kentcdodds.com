One of the exercises in
[my React Performance workshop](/workshops/react-performance) is about code
splitting. I want to show you an extra demo I have to go along with the exercise
because I think it's pretty interesting.

That won't look like much unless you take a look at the network tab. So here's a
screenshot:
