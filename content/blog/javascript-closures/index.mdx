The blog post that is now called
[JavaScript: Pass By Value Function Parameters](/blog/javascript-pass-by-value-function-parameters)
used to be called JavaScript Closures, but I soon realized that I was not
describing closures, but something else entirely.
[I resolved](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/1377650388866752515) to
update this post and retitle that one. I'm halfway done with this. I just
haven't had time to write a new blog post about JavaScript Closures, so thank
you for your patience, and while you're at it, enjoy the original one. It's
pretty interesting ðŸ˜„
